# Top 6 Open Source Tools to Assess the Security of your Cloud Infrastructure

## Introduction
In the shared responsibility model of cloud computing, the responsibility to secure cloud resources lies with the cloud user. However, many organizations overlook this responsibility, leading to poorly architected and mis-configured cloud infrastructures, resulting in data leaks and security breaches. While cloud service providers offer some security tools, they are often limited in scope. Third-party open-source tools can supplement these offerings and provide comprehensive security assessments tailored to your organization's needs. Here are the top six open-source tools for assessing the security of your cloud infrastructure:

### 1. Prowler
